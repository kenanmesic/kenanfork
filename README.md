## User Story

Craft beer enthusiasts are able to search for local breweries by location. The user will be able to submit feedback via input form, which will be saved as a passport themed profile. Their saved profiles will contain their brewery travels, passport stamps earned, as well as both beer and facility reviews. Which can be accessed at any time by logging into the app.

A digital passport stamp is earned when the user meets the following criteria: checking in to the brewery they are visiting and submitting a review of their beer of choice.

A digital stamp is populated and saved in their passport for that brewery, once all guidelines are met by the craft enthusiast.

### Wireframe

The below image is the initial wireframe for the project that gave the basic framework for aesthetic vision, user inteface, and conceptual logic. Various features were changed from the wireframe in alignment with adaptive and flexible processes.

## Features

The deployed application and repository contains the following features:

### UI/UX (HTML & CSS)

* Semantic HTML structuring for accessibility.
* Guided comments along HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to navigate structure.
* Thirty-Party CSS Frameworks, including:
  * Bulma
  * DaFont (installed in assets)
* Media query and flexboxes for various resolutions and devices.
* Consistent styling, including fonts and coloring.
* IDs that connect elements to functions to allow different cards to print to the screen.

### JavaScript

* Global variables that reference elements, including classes and IDs, on HTML page for DOM traversal.
* Appends IDs and elements on the HTML page, and removes/add classes.
* Connects to Third Party API, BeerMapping, to allow users to search for breweries in a designated city location. 
* Check-In form allows collection of data to be stored in a string, including: Brewery Location, Date, Type of Beer, Rating.
* Utilizes localStorage to store data to be printed to the Passport page to reference where they have traveled.
